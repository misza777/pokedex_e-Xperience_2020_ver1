This "Pokedex" project was created for Summer e-Xperience 2020.

In the project directory, please run: `npm start` or just click link: https://misza777.github.io/pokedex_e-Xperience_2020_ver1/

This project is my first work made completely with React JS library, thus it needs some improvements. Unfortunately I did not managed to fix them. 
Here is the short list of main issues: 
- While searching by gender, when you want to click next page or any other page you want, you have do it twice. It's because there is a problem with contolling hook state - ot does not update immediately. 
- Function handleGenderSearch needs to be rebuilt.
- Advanced Pagination should be improoved - to big, especially in mobile versions. 
- Some more issues i did not notice.

I will update it as soon as possible.
Enjoy pokemons.
